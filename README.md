OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
PROJECT:Java program that acts as a basic calculator
OBJECTIVE
User Input Handling: The program prompts the user to enter numerical values (two numbers) and an operation choice.

Conditional Logic and Control Flow: It utilizes conditional statements (switch statement) to select and perform different arithmetic operations based on user input.

Arithmetic Operations: The program demonstrates basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Error Handling: It includes basic error handling to prevent division by zero when performing division.

Output Formatting: The program formats and displays the result of each arithmetic operation in a clear and readable manner.

Use of Scanner Class: It utilizes the Scanner class from Java's java.util package to capture user input from the console.
KEY ACTIVITIES
Input Handling: Prompting the user to input two numbers and an operation choice.

Operation Selection: Providing a menu of operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and allowing the user to choose one.

Arithmetic Operations: Implementing the logic to perform the selected operation on the two input numbers:

Addition: Summing the two numbers.
Subtraction: Finding the difference between the two numbers.
Multiplication: Multiplying the two numbers.
Division: Dividing the first number by the second number (with error handling for division by zero).
Output: Displaying the result of the arithmetic operation to the user in a formatted manner.

Error Handling: Checking for potential errors, such as division by zero, and providing appropriate error messages or handling.

User Interaction: Utilizing the Scanner class to read user input and ensuring proper closing of resources (Scanner object).

Control Flow: Using conditional statements (switch statement) to determine which arithmetic operation to perform based on the user's choice.

Program Termination: Ensuring the program completes its execution after displaying the result and closing any open resources (e.g., Scanner).
TECHNOLOGIES USED
Java Programming Language: Java is the core language used to write the calculator program.
IDE (Integrated Development Environment): IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans are commonly used for Java development. 
Scanner Class: The Scanner class from the java.util package is used to read user input from the console. 
Conditional Statements: Conditional statements (if, else if, switch) are used to evaluate the user's choice of operation and execute the corresponding arithmetic operation based on that choice.
Error Handling: Error handling mechanisms are implemented to manage potential exceptions, such as division by zero (ArithmeticException).
onsole Output: The System.out.println and System.out.printf methods are used to display messages, prompts, and the result of arithmetic operations to the console. 
Basic Java Libraries: While not directly visible, the Java Standard Library provides foundational classes and utilities that support various aspects of the program, including data manipulation, string handling, and more.
